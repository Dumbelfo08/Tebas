# Tebas

Project manager with git support

Command based utility to handle projects. The main focus is user-made templates, that are what provide the useful functionalities.
It will add a **project.tebas** file into your project.

## Templates
These are user made. If you want to make a template, i suggest using my [Tebas Template Creator](https://github.com/Dumbelfo08/TebasTemplateCreator) or looking into how the structure of the [example templates](./templates).
They are [AshFiles](https://github.com/Dumbelfo08/AshLib) with the **.tbtem** extension. You can double click them to install them.

## Scripting language
The templates use a scripting language to provide functionality. You can look into [here](./scripts) for documentation.
Also, there is a Notepad++ Language file to provide syntax highlighting. You can find it [here](./n++).
